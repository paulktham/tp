## Overview
FindOurSEP is a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed for admins handling the allocation of Student Exchange
Program (SEP) locations for Computer Engineering (CEG) students at NUS. The app allows administrators to efficiently
manage the allocation process using automated workflows and data-driven decision-making.
