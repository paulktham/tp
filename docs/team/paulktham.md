## Overview
FindOurSEP is a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed for admins handling the allocation of Student Exchange 
Program (SEP) locations for Computer Engineering (CEG) students at NUS. The app allows administrators to efficiently 
manage the allocation process using automated workflows and data-driven decision-making.

### v1.0 Enhancements: `Student` Class, `University` Class and `UniversityRepository` Class `PrintStudentList` Method Design Improvement
- Student (`Student`) Development
  - Created the class to represent one student applying for SEP, ensuring that it has the right information for the allocator to fairly decide which student is allocated to which University. I also had to think ahead with my team members to decide what helper functions they require so that we can implement other features seamlessly.

- University (`University`) Development
  - Created the University Class which holds the relevant information for each University available to NUS CEG students for exchange. Using this, I populated a class UniversityRepository which has a static HashMap which holds the information of all the Universities.

### v2.0 Enhancements: `Minimum` command
- Minimum Command Implementation
  - Designed and implemented the CriteriaCommand class to allow the admin handling these allocations to set a minimum GPA every student should attain before they can be considered to be eligible to be allocated to a university. This was done by changing the necessary code in `UI` and `allocator` class.
