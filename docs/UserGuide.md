### Language Recognition 
- **Only English language is recognized** in the program. Please ensure that all data inputs use English characters exclusively.

### Data Upload 
- Users can **ONLY upload data at the START of the program**. Please ensure that all necessary data is prepared and ready for upload before initiating the program.
- For further support, please take a look at [Accepted File Format](#accepted-file-format).

### Output Data 
- The `allocation_results` file located under the `data` folder is **NOT meant to be re-inputted into the program**. It is intended solely for external usage by the users. 

### Proper Exit Procedure
- Please exit the program using the `exit` command. Avoid using other methods to terminate the program to ensure a clean and safe shutdown.

Please adhere to these guidelines to ensure smooth and proper functionality of the program.

## Features

### Uploading Information
Upon start-up, the user will see this interface:
```bash
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good day to you!
Before we begin, would you like to:
1. Manually input students data
2. Upload a file (.csv, .txt, .json)
Please choose 1 or 2 or exit :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
The program provides two methods for uploading student data, allowing flexibility in how you input and manage information. Below are the options:

#### Manual Input
By inputting `1`, users can directly enter student data into the program. This option is useful for adding individual records or performing quick updates without needing to upload an entire file.

Subsequently, the user will be met with the following:
```shell
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi! Welcome to FindOurSEP! Enter help for the list of commands.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
The user can then begin using the program by inputting [commands](#notes-about-the-command-format).

#### File Input
If `2` is chosen instead, the users will be asked to upload files in CSV, JSON, or TXT format, containing multiple student records at once. This method is ideal for batch processing, allowing efficient loading of extensive datasets into the program. Each file type follows a specific format for student ID, GPA, and university preferences, ensuring consistent and structured data handling.

Then, the user will be prompted to input the file path to the file.
```shell
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: C:\Users\bob\OneDrive\Documents\tp\test.csv
Please enter the ABSOLUTE path to the file: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**NOTE:** If the test files are in the same folder as the `.jar` file, users can just enter the name of the test file. E.g, `test.json`.

If the file is uploaded successfully, the following will be displayed.
```shell
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File loaded successfully! Let's begin! Enter help for available commands.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
However, if the file has any abnormality, an error message will be displayed to the user. The user will still be allowed to continue using the program but with no data uploaded. 

For e.g, the following is the error message shown when the user's CSV file contains data with wrong formatting.
```shell
A1234567I,5, {12,61,43}, ]" is not in correct format! 
Please ensure that you only have 3 columns representing the ID, GPA and PREFERENCES.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Process error! To re-upload a file, please restart the program by entering 'exit' 
followed by 'no' and ensure file is formatted correctly before retrying. 
Otherwise, you can continue to use the program. Enter help for available commands.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Upon file upload failure, users can continue using the program without any data uploaded. 
To attempt to reload the data, exit and restart the program to try the upload again.

For further support, please take a look at [Accepted File Format](#accepted-file-format).

### *Notes about the command format:*
- Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as help, list and exit) will be ignored.
  - e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as help.
- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple 
lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Set minimum GPA criteria: `minimum`

This sets the minimum GPA for the cohort.

Format: `minimum GPA`
The student must achieve the same or a higher GPA to be considered for exchange. Any student below this GPA will not be allocated to any universities.
e.g.
`minimum 4.0`


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Filter Student: `filter`

Filters student data with a keyword, returning either a list or report.
User can choose between ascending/descending id/gpa and allocation status.

Format: `filter <list/report> <allocated/unallocated>`, 
        or `filter <list> <gpa/id> <ascending/descending>`
e.g. 
`filter list gpa ascending`

```

### View allocation statistics: ``stats``

Displays the average or minimum GPA for the students who have been allocated to the specified partner university.  
Format: `stats -avggpa UNI_INDEX` or `stats -mingpa UNI_INDEX`   
Example output:  

```bash
> stats -avggpa 36
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The average GPA for university index 36 (The University of Hong Kong) is: 3.80
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Displays the index, name, and remaining quota for the specified partner university. 
Format: `viewQuota UNI_INDEX`   
Example output:  

```bash
> viewQuota 58
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index: 58
 Name:  ETH Zurich
 Quota: 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Run allocation algorithm: ``allocate``

Start the allocation algorithm. It will allocate universities to the current student list based on each student's preferences and GPA.  
Format: `allocate`  
Upon successful completion, the console should output:  
```shell
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Allocation algorithm complete! Run generate command to view.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
After which, the user can run the `generate` command to view the results, or `revert` command to undo the allocation.

### Revert allocation outcome: `revert`

Reverses the allocation algorithm. To be used when changes need to be made to the student list.  
Format: `revert`
Upon successful completion, the console should output:  
```shell
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Revert complete! Run the allocate command whenever you are ready.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Generate report of allocation: `generate`
Outputs all students' ID and allocated university in an ASCII table. 
Used for viewing the results of the allocation process.

Format: `generate`

Example output:
```shell
Here is the allocation report:
┌───────────┬───────────────────────────────┐
│ Student   │ University Granted            │
├───────────┼───────────────────────────────┤
│ A1234567I │ Chongqing University          │
│ A2113113X │ National Tsing Hua University │
└───────────┴───────────────────────────────┘
```

### Exit Program: `bye`, `exit`, `quit`
When any of the exit commands (bye, exit, quit) are entered, the program will prompt the user (`Do you want to save your results?`) to save their allocation results. If the user choose `yes`, they will be prompted to enter the desired file format (CSV, JSON, TXT).
Based on their selection, the program will save the results in the specified format.

File Formats:
- CSV: Your data will be saved in a comma-separated values format, making it easy to open in spreadsheet applications.
- JSON: The data will be structured in a JSON format, suitable for data interchange and storage.
- TXT: Your results will be saved in a plain text format, which can be opened in any text editor.

Once the save operation is complete, the program will exit gracefully. 

If the user choose not to save the results, the program will end immediately without saving any data.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Below is an example of an `exit` scenario.
```shell
> exit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you want to save your results?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> yes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please choose a file type (CSV, JSON, TXT) to save your results.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> json
Allocation results saved to JSON file at data/allocation_results.json
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adios, amigo!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
In the above case, the data will be stored in the relative path: `.../data/allocation_results.json`. 

**IMPORTANT**: Please note that if the file already exists, its contents will be overwritten.
